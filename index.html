		<article>I don't really have anything to say so.....I'll just type whatever is in my head instead to fill the page because....
		Paragraph 1 still not really filled with anything but ohh well I tried. Better than nothing but let's continue typing just to fill up the page. I hope sir doesn't think I'm idling but I'm typing this at 12:34 am EST so the creatvity in my brain has shut off and I'm just doing a lot of work at this point to try and get as much done as possible because I have a lot of work to do. Anywho I'm done filling up paragraph 1.
		
		I really tried to find something but I didn't so I'll just continue typing to see what I can think of to type this time. I'm up listening to all kinds of nonsense in an effort to keep myself awake because I'm severly sleep deprived but that's just how it is when it comes to university. It couldv'e been worse. I couldv'e had a mental breakdown like many of friends probably will have as the school term continues. Ohhh well. This is the end of paragraph 2.

			Onward to paragraph 3 we go....at this point I legitimatley am just typing whatever comes in my head without actually thinking it through. I wonder what pictures I will use? Who knows? We'll have to see because I'd love to know because I have no idea what I'll be doing but that's the fun of guessing. I just realized I have the 27th for the first article and now I have 28 for the second one but then again I've been typing since the 27th so that may explain it. Lol the explanantions I give are amazing if I wasn't tired I'd laugh. Anywho end of paragraph 3.

			You know what I shouldv'e done instead of being here type.....I should've just taken a random paragraph from google but then again I'd probably get in problems for doing that. Plagarism is a thing....bwoyy.....ohhhh well. This is basically how I think when I'm very very veryyy tired. I just think of a million things aren't necessarily connected but that's how it is. Anywho this is the end of the fourth and final paragraph.
